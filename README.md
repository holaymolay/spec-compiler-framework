# CERES Spec Compiler
Part of the CERES (Coordinated Emergent Reasoning System). Umbrella repo: [CERES](https://github.com/holaymolay/ceres-coordinated-emergent-reasoning-system).


## Why This Exists

Deterministic CLI pipeline that converts raw human intent into governed specification artifacts.

## Audience

**Include**
- Repository maintainers who need enforceable, audit-friendly specs from human intent.
- Governance and platform engineers standardizing spec workflows for downstream automation.
- Operators running deterministic pipelines that must refuse ambiguous inputs.

**Exclude**
- Teams seeking automatic requirement generation or creative drafting.
- Workflows that allow LLMs or tools to fill in missing decisions implicitly.

## Problem

Specs generated with ad hoc prompts or LLM retries drift, hide assumptions, and cannot be audited or trusted for downstream automation.

## Solution

A compiler-style CLI with hard stage gates (intent capture, clarification, normalization, validation, prompt synthesis) that refuses to proceed on missing decisions, enforces governance rules mechanically, and emits Codex-ready prompts only after deterministic checks pass. Entry point: README.md (you are here); drill-down runbook: docs/usage.md.

## Outcomes

Expected outcomes:

- Capture raw human intent without normalization or enrichment.
- Surface missing decisions as deterministic blocking questions until resolved.
- Normalize clarified intent into governed specs with traceable validation and security defaults.
- Validate specs against non-negotiable rules and synthesize Codex prompts only on passing validation.
- Validate renderer outputs against the Renderer Contract for deterministic UI artifacts.
- Enforce taste rules from the visual constitution and design intent; fail builds on taste regressions.
- Document how to operate the pipeline (local or CI) without LLMs or implicit assumptions.
- Guide users from README.md into detailed docs/usage.md for step-by-step execution.

## Quick Start

Run these steps:

1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. node dist/cli.js intent --input intent/intent.raw.yaml
4. node dist/cli.js clarify
5. node dist/cli.js normalize --spec-id <id> && node dist/cli.js validate --spec-id <id>
6. node dist/cli.js renderer-validate && node dist/cli.js taste
7. node dist/cli.js synthesize --spec-id <id>

## Non-Goals

This tool explicitly avoids:

- Generate application code or business logic.
- Invoke LLMs or infer requirements automatically.
- Proceed past stage gates when clarification is incomplete.
- Bypass governance validation or acceptance criteria mapping.
- Serve as a general-purpose documentation generator beyond this compiler.

## Constraints

Hard constraints:

- Max length: 5200 chars
- Banned terms: magic, automagic
- Tone profile: neutral
