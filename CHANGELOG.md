# Changelog

**AI-managed file — humans should not edit this directly.** Add a dated entry for each completed task.

## Unreleased
- Pending entries.

## 2025-12-24
- Bootstrap governance scaffolding, run-record helpers, and the deterministic `spec-compile` CLI implementing the PROMPT A pipeline (intent → clarify → normalize → validate → synthesize). (ledger: 2025-12-24 — spec-generation-framework bootstrap; run: run-2025-12-24-bootstrap)
- Removed business-specific intent/clarification artifacts and added ignores for compiler outputs to keep the repository framework-only. (ledger: 2025-12-24 — Framework sanitization; run: run-2025-12-24-clean)
