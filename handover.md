# Handover

**AI-managed file — humans should not edit this directly.** Keep this file synchronized with active tasks and context ledgers.

## Current Focus
- Maintain governance scaffolding and await project requirements to run the compiler pipeline.

## Recent Progress
- Established governance scaffolding (`todo*`, backlog/completed/handover, run receipts, context ledgers).
- Implemented `spec-compile` CLI stages (intent → clarify → normalize → validate → synthesize) with deterministic rule checks.
- Added framework config defaults, run-record schema/scripts, and initial planner ledger entry; recorded run `run-2025-12-24-bootstrap`.
- Removed business-specific intent/clarification artifacts and added ignore rules so the framework remains generic/open-source ready.
- Published the initial repository to GitHub (`holaymolay/spec-compiler-framework`).

## Next Steps
- Capture the first intent payload via `spec-compile intent` once requirements arrive.
- Resolve clarifications/responses and drive through normalization, validation, and synthesis for the incoming project scope.

## Pending Input
- Project description and requirements to seed `intent/intent.raw.yaml`.
